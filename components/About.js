      About Me
    </h2>
    <p>
      Currently, I call myself a Developer, but in my daily routine, I work as a Full-stack Developer. I have been working professionally in this area since 2013. And with the passing of time, I have called myself  a PHP Developer, working with MVC frameworks and Wordpress cms.  
    </p> 

    <p>I focused for a while on e-Commerce using techs like Woocommerce and Prestashop, I was with this for 3 years. During this time I worked from home.</p>

    <p>After this time i wanted to work in digital marketing agencies, where I would have the opportunities to work and develop with many kinds of systems. During this period I met NodeJs and I have loved them ever since.</p>

    <p>It was what I have fun with . I know Vue and React. And since of this moment, I have changed my work area. Currently, I work in Frontend.   Perhaps with that I can work with a lot of things on Backend with Nodejs.</p>

    <p>And this has been my focus, Being a Javascript Developer</p>
